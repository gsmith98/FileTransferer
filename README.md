# FileTransferer
An implementation of Selective Repeat ARQ for file transfer

This is a project originally completed in Fall 2014. It transfers a file using Selective Repeat ARQ to be resistant to packet loss.

The files Distributed1pre-doc.txt and Results.txt in the root of this directory contain some further explanation of the project, though they were written before the project was fully completed.
